Here you can find my solutions (and also failed attempts) for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) using Kotlin. I try to be as much idiomatic as possible and write clean code over hacky/smarty solution.

* [Day 2](./src/main/kotlin/day02)

My solutions for [other](https://github.com/JavierMF/AdventOfCode2022) [years](https://github.com/JavierMF/AdventOfCode2020).
